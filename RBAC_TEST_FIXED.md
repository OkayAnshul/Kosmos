# RBAC Test Script - UUID Fix Applied âœ…

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Ready to run
**File:** `RBAC_MANUAL_TEST_SCRIPT.sql`

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem:
The original test script used simple string IDs like `'test-project-rbac-001'`, but Supabase tables require **UUID format** for ID fields.

**Error encountered:**
```
ERROR: 22P02: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "test-project-rbac-001"
```

### Solution Applied:
Replaced all test IDs with valid UUID format:

| Old ID | New UUID |
|--------|----------|
| `'user-admin-001'` | `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'` |
| `'user-manager-002'` | `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002'` |
| `'user-member-003'` | `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003'` |
| `'user-admin-004'` | `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004'` |
| `'test-project-rbac-001'` | `'10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'` |

## Ready to Run

The test script is now **100% compatible** with Supabase's UUID requirements.

### Quick Start:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor:**
   ```
   https://krbfvekgqbcwjgntepip.supabase.co/project/krbfvekgqbcwjgntepip/sql
   ```

2. **Load the script:**
   ```bash
   cat RBAC_MANUAL_TEST_SCRIPT.sql
   ```

3. **Copy and paste** the entire script into Supabase SQL Editor

4. **Click "Run"**

5. **Verify results** - scroll through output to check each step passed

---

## What the Test Will Verify

âœ… **Step 1:** All 7 database tables exist
âœ… **Step 2:** Test user created (ADMIN)
âœ… **Step 3:** Project created with auto-ADMIN membership
âœ… **Step 4:** MANAGER added with correct role hierarchy
âœ… **Step 5:** MEMBER added (3 members total with weight-based hierarchy)
âœ… **Step 6:** Task created with role tracking (ADMIN â†’ MANAGER assignment)
âœ… **Step 7:** Second task created (MANAGER â†’ MEMBER assignment)
âœ… **Step 8:** Business rule verified (cannot remove last ADMIN, but can after adding second)
âœ… **Step 9:** Permission sets verified for each role
âœ… **Step 10:** Final summary shows complete project stats

---

## Expected Final Result

After running the complete script, Step 10 should show:

```
project_name: RBAC Verification Project
status: ACTIVE
visibility: PRIVATE
owner_email: admin@rbactest.kosmos
total_members: 4
admin_count: 2
manager_count: 1
member_count: 1
total_tasks: 2
```

---

## If All Tests Pass

**Phase 1A RBAC Implementation is 100% COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰**

Next steps:
1. âœ… Mark Phase 1A as complete in `DEVELOPMENT_LOGBOOK.md`
2. âœ… Optional: Run cleanup queries to remove test data
3. âœ… Move to Phase 2: User Discovery & Chat Implementation

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see UUID errors:
- Check that you copied the **entire** updated script
- Verify no old string IDs remain (search for `'test-project-rbac-001'`)

### If foreign key errors occur:
- Ensure you ran all 7 SQL setup scripts from `SUPABASE_SQL_SETUP_QUICK_START.md`
- Check that tables were created in the correct order

### If duplicate key errors:
- Test data already exists from previous run
- Run the cleanup queries at the bottom of the script first
