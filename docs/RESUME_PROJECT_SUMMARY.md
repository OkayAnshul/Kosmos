## 📝 INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### "Tell me about a challenging project you worked on"
*"I developed Kosmos, a real-time collaboration platform, where the biggest challenge was implementing offline-first architecture. Users needed full functionality without internet, but also real-time sync when online. I designed a hybrid system using Room for local storage and Supabase for cloud sync, with conflict resolution for simultaneous edits. This resulted in 100% feature parity between modes."*

### "Describe a time you optimized performance"
*"In Kosmos, initial chat load time was 2 seconds for 50 messages, which felt sluggish. I profiled the app using Android Profiler, identified inefficient database queries without indexes, and redesigned the query strategy with compound indexes on frequently accessed columns. Load time dropped to under 500ms - a 75% improvement that drastically enhanced user experience."*

### "How do you approach system architecture?"
*"For Kosmos, I used Clean Architecture with MVVM, separating concerns into presentation (Compose UI), domain (ViewModels), and data (Repositories) layers. I utilized Hilt for dependency injection to keep modules loosely coupled and testable. This made it easy to migrate from Firebase to Supabase without touching UI code - I only swapped out repository implementations."*
